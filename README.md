### Libraries

* **P5.js**
* **Javascript**

### Explanation
This Project uses neural-network & genetic algorithm for bird's brain. Input of the neural network consists of Bird's y-position, closest distance to the pipe x-distance, upper pipe's y-dist and bottom pipe's y-distance. The output will be probabilty score of between 0 and 1, if greater than 0.5 jump else don't jump.
